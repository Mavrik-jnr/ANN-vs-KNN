# ANN-vs-KNN
This is a project that compares two machine learning algorithms: The Artificial Neural Network and The K Nearest Neighbors. The comparison is done on text-independent Speaker recognition tasks. the dataset used is a kaggle dataset of segmented speeches of 5 prominent leaders. Benjamin Netanyahu, Jens Stoltenberg, Julia Gillard, Margaret Tacher and Nelson Mandela. Link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kongaevans/speaker-recognition-dataset. The Evaluation metrics used to compare the two algorithms are Accuracy, False Acceptance Rate (FAR), False Rejection Rate, Confusion Matrix, Recall, Precision, AUC, F1_Score, and ROC.
